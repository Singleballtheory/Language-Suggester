Temporarily using this for an outline space

Main goals:
create five questions with accompanying select boxes in card 1
cards 2 3 and 4 will house three language descriptions (initially hidden)
include a submit button at the bottom of card 1
assign point values for each response
upon submit, add up point values
sum will determine which language is revealed 
include a reset button that allows person to make new selections/get new result

stretch goals:
allow for a separate description p-text to pop up in addition to the language card being displayed
actually try to create relevant questions that will legitimately reveal a suitable language
have multiple p-text results depending upon where within the spectrum their total points fall 
    (ie, 1-10 will show java, but 1-5 reveals different p-text than 6-10)
